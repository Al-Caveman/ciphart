 -d        only decrypt input ciphertext into output plaintext.
 -k        only derive a more secure key.
 -ek       equals '-e', but also derives a more secure key.
 -dk       equals '-d', but also derives a more secure key.
 -w        show warranty notice.
 -c        show usage conditions.
 -h        show this help.
